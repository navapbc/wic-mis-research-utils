# WIC MIS Research Utils

General utilities for our research process

For now, add new tools by:

1. Start a new branch `<username>-<tool-name-or-purpose>`
2. Create a new directory in this one
3. Add a `README.md` for the new tool/script
4. Add your code, and any instructions for running it in the `README`
5. Open a pull request (we will discuss PR standards soon)
